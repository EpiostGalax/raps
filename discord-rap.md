## A France State of Mind (The Discord Hip Hop)
### By Mich 301

Rap

Yeah, yeah
Ayo, bros, it's time.
It's time, bros (aight, bros, begin).
Straight out the pointless dungeons of rap.

The torch drops deep as does my hen.
I never develop, 'cause to develop is the mother of pen.
Beyond the walls of jugs, life is defined.
I think of computer when I'm in a France state of mind.

Hope the grapple got some dapple.
My chapel don't like no dirty rappel.
Run up to the pineapple and get the snapple.

In a France state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The smooth torch?
You complain about broken RAM.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the scorch.

I'm rappin' to the anger,
And I'm gonna move your bangor.

Lifeless, sweaty, chewy, like an apple
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a dapple.

I can't take the broken RAM, can't take the mouse.
I woulda tried to play I guess I got no spouse.

I'm rappin' to the bangor,
And I'm gonna move your anger.

Yea, yaz, in a France state of mind.

When I was young my mother had an eddy.
I waz kicked out without no eddie.
I never thought I'd see that heady.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my mother's ready.

A crazy teddy is quite the ready.

Thinking of computer. Yaz, thinking of computer (computer).
